I can only try them on a very small data sample (20,000 ratings), and ended up getting pretty high Root Mean Squared Error (bad recommendations). Memory-based collaborative filtering approaches that compute distance relationships between items or users have these two major issues:\n","\n","1. It doesn't scale particularly well to massive datasets, especially for real-time recommendations based on user behavior similarities - which takes a lot of computations.\n","2. Ratings matrices may be overfitting to noisy representations of user tastes and preferences. When we use distance based \"neighborhood\" approaches on raw data, we match to sparse low-level details that we assume represent the user's preference vector instead of the vector itself.\n","\n","Thus I'd need to apply **Dimensionality Reduction** technique to derive the tastes and preferences from the raw data, otherwise known as doing low-rank matrix factorization. Why reduce dimensions?\n","\n","* I can discover hidden correlations / features in the raw data.\n","* I can remove redundant and noisy features that are not useful.\n","* I can interpret and visualize the data easier.\n","* I can also access easier data storage and processing.\n","\n","With that goal in mind, I'll introduce Singular Vector Decomposition (SVD) to you, a powerful dimensionality reduction technique that is used heavily in modern model-based CF recommender system.\n","\n","![dim-red](images/dimensionality-reduction.jpg)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"AXF8Vly_r_wC"},"source":["## Loading the Dataset\n","Let's load the 3 data files just like

As it captures the underlying features driving the raw data, it can scale significantly better to massive datasets as well as make better recommendations based on user's tastes.\n","\n","However, we still likely lose some meaningful signals by using a low-rank approximation. Specifically, there's an interpretability problem as a singular vector specifies a linear combination of all input columns or rows. There's also a lack of sparsity when the singular vectors are quite dense. Thus, SVD approach is limited to linear projections."]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 2","language":"python","name":"python2"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":2},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython2","version":"2.7.14"},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
